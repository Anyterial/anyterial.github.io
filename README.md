httk example website
--------------------

This repository is a simple example how to set up a website with a blog using the httkweb site generator. You can fork it, edit the contents under `src/content` and if you keep it on GitHub, the attached workflow in `.github/actions/httkweb.yaml` should automatically generate and publish it via GitHub pages.
